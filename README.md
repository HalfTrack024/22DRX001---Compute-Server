You can modify the default README.md file to communicate important information about your repository. The README file will always appear on the main page of the repository when viewed in the Copia Web App.

To upload a new file, use the "New File" or "Upload File" options. For the best experience, Copia recommends that you manage your files through the Desktop App by navigating to the "Create Clone" dropdown and selecting the "Open in Desktop App" option. By using the Copia Desktop App, you can take advantage of several advanced functionalities, like auto-archiving Siemens projects.
